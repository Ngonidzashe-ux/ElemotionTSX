            EleMotion presents a novel, cost-effective, and scalable solution to
            surface biopotential monitoring by introducing highly conductive,
            flexible, and ultra-thin micro-needle electrodes (MNEs), fabricated
            using a 3D electrodeposition method. Unlike conventional Ag/AgCl gel
            electrodes, these MNEs eliminate the need for skin pre-treatment,
            discomfort, potential skin irritation, and the issue of signal
            degradation over time. Compared to existing dry electrodes, the
            invention overcomes the problems of high materials cost, low
            adhesiveness, and low flexibility. This innovative design ensures
            the MNEs have excellent conductivity, adhere comfortably to the skin
            without causing pain, and maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio,
            marking a significant advancement in the field of wearable
            electrophysiology monitoring.

            EleMotion provides a lightweight, wireless, and customizable
            solution to surface biopotential monitoring by introducing a highly
            integrated, modularized, wireless sensing node to build the
            customized personal sensing network. Compared to traditional bulky
            surface biopotential sensing systems with tedious wiring and noisy
            signals, our highly integrated sensing nodes are embedded with the
            wireless transmission while only weighing 15g, which could be easily
            attached to the target muscle without affecting their movement or
            adding extra burden. With the independent sensing node design, users
            could design their unique sensing protocol with customized node
            numbers and layouts. By adopting a universal wireless transmission
            protocol, this system could be easily embedded with other
            motion-tracking systems for complex neuromuscular model development.
            This novel design provides excellent convenience in long-term
            biopotential monitoring and enables clinical staff and researchers

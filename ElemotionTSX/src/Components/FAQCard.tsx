    /* Anchor tag that is wrapping everything. Has an onclick event to ensure that you scroll to the top of the section position you are looking for. 
       <a>: This is an HTML anchor element, also known as a hyperlink. It is used to create clickable links within a web page.
href={#${id}}: This is the href attribute of the anchor element. It is set using a template literal enclosed in backticks (``). The template literal
 allows you to embed JavaScript expressions inside the string.
#${id}: This is the expression inside the template literal. It is dynamically evaluating the id variable and inserting its value as part of the URL. 
The expression #${id} creates a URL fragment that starts with a hash symbol (#) followed by the value of the id variable.
The usage of a URL fragment with the hash symbol (#) allows you to create internal links that scroll to specific sections or elements within the same page. It's a common technique used for smooth scrolling navigation within a single-page application or long-scrolling websites.*/
